# Computational Morphology partial work: Decomposing Fusional Morphemes with Vector Embeddings
This repository contains the implementation of the partial work of the Computational Morphology course. The work consists on a summary of "Decomposing Fusional Morphemes with Vector Embeddings" work ( Ginn and Palmer 2024) and a replication of the experiments. The research focuses on training vector embedding models on morphological sequences from Uspanteko and Tsez, examining whether the learned embeddings correlate with manually created linguistic feature vectors. The results provide insights into the viability of distributional methods for fusional morphology, even with limited data.
